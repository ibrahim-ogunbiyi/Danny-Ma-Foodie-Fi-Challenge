## Customer Journey
Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customer‚Äôs onboarding journey.

Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

#### Steps for Achieving the Result:

```sql
SELECT
	customer_id,
	plan_name,
	start_date
FROM subscriptions
INNER JOIN plans 
USING(plan_id)
WHERE customer_id IN (1, 2, 11, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19)
```

**Result**
| customer_id | plan_name      | start_date |
