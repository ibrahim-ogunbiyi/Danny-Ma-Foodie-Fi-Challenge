## 1. How would you calculate the rate of growth for foodie-fi ?
There are a lot of metrics that can be used to calculate the rate of growth for Foodie-Fi. These metrics include calculating the change in the number of customers who signed up based on time. Another one is determining the number of customers who signed up based on a trial and eventually purchased a plan.

## 2. What key metrics would you recommend Foodie-Fi management to track over time to assess performance of their overall business?
- Retention Rate: Retention rate is a metric that measures the percentage of customers or subscribers who continue to use a product or service over a specific period.
- Churn Rate: Churn rate, also known as attrition rate, is a metric that measures the percentage of customers who stop using a product or service during a specific time frame.
- Customer Acquisition Rate: Customer acquisition rate is a metric that quantifies the number of new customers acquired by a business during a specific time period.
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR): Monthly Recurring Revenue is a financial metric that represents the total revenue a business expects to receive from its subscription-based customers on a monthly basis.
- Average Revenue Per User (ARPU): ARPU calculates the average revenue generated from each customer on a monthly basis.

## 3. What are some key customer journeys or experiences that you would analyse further to improve customer retention?
How did customers transition from the trial to other plans, and what happened? Is it the case that as they moved from one plan to another, they weren't experiencing more benefits, or was there another reason?

## 4. If the Foodie-Fi team were to create an exit survey shown to customers who wish to cancel their subscription, what questions would you include in the survey?	
- Reasons for churning: Due to price, competition, not enough content.
- Do you have any recommendations you can provide for us?
- Overall experience
- Rate our customer support
- Demographic information like location

## 5. What business levers could the Foodie-Fi team use to reduce the customer churn rate? How would you validate the effectiveness of your ideas?
To me, this is not deterministic yet. It's only after obtaining the analysis results that I can determine the likely cause. Once I analyze the results, I will then use A/B testing to verify my assumptions from the analysis. For example, if the analysis reveals that the reason for customer churn is related to pricing, then I will conduct an A/B test to verify those assumptions.
